# Java Pixel Editor

A Pixel Art Editor written in Java, using swing.

It's being rewritten in C++ using Qt, check out my repository for the project

## Running

With the addition of the Makefile, just run `make`. Look in the Makefile for the java commands it runs. Contaminates the source tree sadly but I'm not looking to develop this project further, just an easy way to build it
